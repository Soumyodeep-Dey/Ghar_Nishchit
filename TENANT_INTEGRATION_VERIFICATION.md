## 🔌 Backend API Verification

### Endpoints Used by Tenant Components:

| Endpoint | Method | Component | Status |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| `/api/auth/profile` | GET | Dashboard, Maintenance | ✅ Available |
| `/api/properties` | GET | Property | ✅ Available |
| `/api/maintenance/tenant/:id` | GET | Dashboard, Maintenance | ✅ Available |
| `/api/maintenance` | POST | Maintenance | ✅ Available |
| `/api/maintenance/:id` | PUT | Maintenance | ✅ Available |
| `/api/maintenance/:id` | DELETE | Maintenance | ✅ Available |
| `/api/payments/create-order` | POST | TenantPayment | ✅ Available |
| `/api/payments/verify` | POST | TenantPayment | ✅ Available |
| `/api/landlord-payments/create-order` | POST | LandlordPayment | ✅ Available |
| `/api/landlord-payments/verify` | POST | LandlordPayment | ✅ Available |

### Backend Routes Configuration:
```javascript
✓ app.use("/api/properties", propertyRoutes)
✓ app.use("/api/auth", authRoutes)
✓ app.use("/api/tenants", tenantRoutes)
✓ app.use("/api/maintenance", maintenanceRoutes)
```

---

## 🛡️ Error Handling Verification

### Pattern Used (Consistent Across All Files):
```javascript
try {
  setIsLoading(true);
  const data = await api.someMethod();
  // Transform and set data
  setState(transformedData);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Detailed error:', error);
  showErrorToast('User-friendly message');
  setState([]); // Safe fallback
} finally {
  setIsLoading(false);
}
```

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ All API calls wrapped in try-catch
- ✅ Loading states properly managed
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Safe fallback values
- ✅ Finally block ensures loading state reset

---

## 🎯 Toast Notifications Verification

### Usage Patterns:

**Success Operations:**
```javascript
✓ Property favorite toggle → "Favorite updated"
✓ Maintenance created → "Maintenance request submitted successfully"
✓ Maintenance updated → "Request updated successfully"
✓ Maintenance deleted → "Request deleted successfully"
✓ Payment completed → "Payment completed successfully!"
✓ Receipt downloaded → "Receipt downloaded successfully"
```

**Error Operations:**
```javascript
✓ Dashboard load fail → "Failed to load dashboard data"
✓ Properties load fail → "Failed to load properties"
✓ Maintenance load fail → "Failed to load maintenance requests"
✓ Create fail → "Failed to submit request"
✓ Update fail → "Failed to update request"
✓ Delete fail → "Failed to delete request"
```

**Info Operations:**
```javascript
✓ Missing fields → "Please fill in all required fields"
✓ Payment redirect → "Redirecting to payment gateway..."
```

---

## 📊 Data Transformation Verification

### Property Data Transformation ✅
**Backend Format → Frontend Format:**
```javascript
{
  _id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"     → id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"
  title: "Modern Apartment"            → title: "Modern Apartment"
  price: 1500                          → price: "$1500/month"
  address: "123 Main St"               → location: "123 Main St"
  description: "Beautiful..."          → description: "Beautiful..."
  images: ["url1", "url2"]             → image: "url1"
  bedrooms: 2                          → bedrooms: 2
  bathrooms: 1                         → bathrooms: 1
                                       → favorite: false (local only)
}
```

### Maintenance Data Transformation ✅
**Backend Format → Frontend Format:**
```javascript
{
  _id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"     → id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"
  title: "Plumbing Issue"              → title: "Plumbing Issue"
  issueType: "Leak"                    → (used if title missing)
  description: "Water leak..."         → description: "Water leak..."
  priority: "High"                     → priority: "High"
  status: "Pending"                    → status: "Pending"
  createdAt: "2025-10-30T10:00:00Z"   → date: "2025-10-30T10:00:00Z"
  reportedDate: "2025-10-30"           → (fallback for date)
}
```

**Fallback Values Verified:**
- ✅ Missing title → "Maintenance Request"
- ✅ Missing description → "No description"
- ✅ Missing priority → "Medium"
- ✅ Missing status → "Pending"
- ✅ Missing date → new Date().toISOString()

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow Verification

### Token Management ✅
```javascript
✓ Token stored in localStorage as 'token' or 'authToken'
✓ Automatically included in all API requests
✓ getAuthHeader() function in api.js handles retrieval
✓ Authorization: Bearer {token} header format
```

### Profile Fetching ✅
```javascript
✓ Used to get tenant ID for maintenance requests
✓ Called before making tenant-specific requests
✓ Properly handled if profile fetch fails
```

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Verification

### Loading States ✅
- ✅ Dashboard: Spinner with "Loading Dashboard..."
- ✅ Properties: Skeleton cards with pulse animation
- ✅ Maintenance: Spinner with "Loading Maintenance..."
- ✅ Payments: Spinner with "Loading Payments..."

### Empty States ✅
- ✅ No properties: "No properties found" with reset button
- ✅ No requests: "No maintenance requests found" with create button
- ✅ All caught up: "All caught up!" for payments
- ✅ Filtered results: "No requests match your filters"

### Interactive Elements ✅

- ✅ Smooth transitions
- ✅ Responsive modals
- ✅ Form validation feedback

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### 1. Payment System
- ✅ Backend payment API implemented
- ✅ Razorpay gateway connected for tenant and landlord flows
- ⚠️ Some UI state still persists locally for display, but payment creation and verification are server-backed

### 2. Favorites System
- ⚠️ Favorite toggle is local only
- 📋 TODO: Implement favorites backend API
- 📋 TODO: Persist favorites across sessions

### 3. Notifications
- ⚠️ Uses localStorage
- 📋 TODO: Implement notifications backend API
- 📋 TODO: Real-time updates via WebSocket (optional)
