# Tenant Error Messaging Update

## Changes Made

Updated the Tenant Management page to properly distinguish between different empty states:

### 1. Added Error State Tracking
- Added `hasLoadError` state to track if there was an actual backend error
- This allows us to show different messages for different scenarios

### 2. Improved Error Notifications
Changed notification titles and messages to be more specific:

| Scenario | Title | Message |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Backend Error (Generic) | "Backend Error" | "There was a problem loading your tenant list. Please try again later." |
| Server Error (500) | "Server Error" | "The backend server encountered an error. Please try again later." |
| Authentication Error (401/403) | "Authentication Required" | "Your session has expired. Please log in again." |
| Network Connection Error | "Connection Failed" | "Unable to connect to the server. Please ensure the backend is running." |
| No Internet | "No Internet Connection" | "Please check your internet connection and try again." |

### 3. Three Different Empty State Messages

Now the UI shows different messages based on the situation:

#### A. Backend Error (hasLoadError = true)
```
üö´ Backend Error
There was a problem connecting to the server.
Please check the error notification above and try again.
```

#### B. No Tenants at All (tenants.length = 0)
```
üë• No Tenants Yet
You don't have any tenant inquiries yet.
Tenants will appear here when they inquire about your properties.
```

#### C. Tenants Exist but Filtered Out
```
üîç No Matching Tenants
No tenants match your current filters.
Try adjusting your search criteria or filters to see results.
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Generic "Failed to Load Tenants" message for all scenarios
- Users couldn't tell if it was a backend issue or just no data

### After
- Clear distinction between:
  1. **Backend problems** ‚Üí Shows error, suggests checking notifications
  2. **No tenant data** ‚Üí Friendly message explaining this is normal
  3. **Filtered results** ‚Üí Suggests adjusting filters

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Landlord (No Inquiries)
- Backend works ‚úÖ
- Returns empty array []
- Shows: **"No Tenants Yet"** with helpful message about waiting for inquiries

### Scenario 2: Backend Down
- Backend fails ‚ùå
- Error caught
- Shows: **"Backend Error"** with technical troubleshooting message
- Red notification toast appears

### Scenario 3: Landlord with Tenants, Using Filters
- Backend works ‚úÖ
- Has tenants but all filtered out
- Shows: **"No Matching Tenants"** with suggestion to adjust filters

## Testing

To test the different states:

1. **No Tenants**: Login with a landlord who has no inquiries
2. **Backend Error**: Stop the backend server and reload
3. **Filtered Out**: Have tenants, then filter by a non-existent property
4. **Auth Error**: Clear localStorage and reload
